# SUSbot (IS NO LONGER THE GO-TO REPO, I'M RESTARTING FROM SCRATCH [HERE](https://github.com/BojayB/SUSbot)

I'm sorry, this was archived Feb 4th 2023, but i unarchived it because the repo title was BojayB/SUSbot-Depricated-, and the - at the end was pissing me off. It is now rearchived as of May 5th 2023, 3:26 AM.

A stolen DiscordJS bot

SUSbot is run locally on my machine, you can invite him here: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=808940178281463809&permissions=8&scope=bot
(Administrative permissions, you can take a look at the commands, they don't steal your info.)
When SUSbot is offline, it's either very temporary because I'm testing changes (temporary as in he'll be offline for like 5 seconds, but I may restart the bot extremely often when he's online so I appologize for the inconvenience) or I'm not at home / my pc is turned off.



# COMMANDS
A the full list can be downloaded here: https://github.com/BojayB/SUSbot/COMMANDS.md
(Default prefix is ?, going to add a function that allows you to change the prefix like most bots eventually)
`?commands` Lists all of the available commands


  
## CREDS
I WAS ripping of Ninjamuffin's readme but I've changed my mind. Everything important came from here: https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/FulpTronJS
